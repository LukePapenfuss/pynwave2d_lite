Performance Testing:
-----------------------------------

I tried a few things.  Some gave too much info, which then became difficult
to interpret.

1.  Pyinstrument.  This worked better than others.  The output can be
    viewed in a browser by passing the "-o outputfile.html" flag.
    Otherwise, the results are shown as text.

    pyinstrument -o level9.html d1.py

2.  cProfile gave too much info about very low-level routines.  I found
    it difficult to connect with code in my script.  
    (At least using default settings)  The best way to view the results
    was with snakeviz

    python -m cProfile -o temp.dat d1.p
    snakeviz temp.dat
